## Car Crashes Data Analysis 

This dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of car crash data across different states, focusing on key risk factors such as alcohol consumption, speeding, and driver behavior.  
The objective of this analysis is to identify high-risk and low-risk regions, understand accident patterns, and evaluate their impact on insurance premiums and losses.

By leveraging data-driven insights, this dashboard helps insurance companies, analysts, and decision-makers design effective risk-based pricing strategies, optimize policy offerings, and promote road safety initiatives.
